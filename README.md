# Rails Blog App

This is the project of a simple blog, developed using the Ruby on Rails framework. Its purpose is to get familiar with the basic file structure and commands of Rails and with the deployment process with Heroku.

It was developed following the steps outlined in the [Jumpstart Lab’s Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html).

## How to run the app

To run this app in your local computer (after downloading the repo), you need to install Rails (I am assuming you already have Ruby on your machine) and run its corresponding server. Type the following command on terminal.

```
$ gem install rails
```

Then, change to the project directory, start the server (``` $ rails server ```) and go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
